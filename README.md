Development life cycle â€“ involves capturing the initial requirements from the customer, expanding on these to provide the detail required for code production, writing the code and testing the product, ready for release

Waterfall/Linear/Sequential Model:
- shows the steps in sequence where the requirements are progressively refined to the point where coding can take place.
- Each activity is completed before moving on to the next
- Testing is carried out once the code has been fully developed
