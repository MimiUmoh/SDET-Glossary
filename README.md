 ### DataTypes
  Data types in Ruby represents different types of data like text, string, numbers, etc. All data types are based on classes because it is a Object-Oriented language. There are different data types in Ruby as follows:

                  Numbers
                  Boolean
                  Strings
                  Hashes
                  Arrays
                  Symbols

  Numbers: Generally a number is defined as a series of digits and by using a dot as a decimal mark. There are different kinds of numbers like integers and float.

    E.g. Integer = 3, 30, 300, 3000
         Float = 1.2, 1.23, 1.234, 1.2345

  Boolean: Boolean data type represents only one bit of information either true(1) or false(0).
