Four Pillars of Oject Oriented Programming

### Abstraction

Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming. In abstraction, the programmer hides all the irrelevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency—hiding the implementation details while presenting the essential features to the user. An example of abstraction can be given with a database system. The user does not know how the data is stored and how the data is maintained to a very technical degree. The complexities are hidden from the user; only that which is essential is exposed.

### Encapsulation

Similar to abstraction, encapsulation also hides data, but this time, for the purpose of protection. Encapsulation binds data and functions that manipulate that data into a single unit such as a class (which is a model of objects). For example, in ruby, encapsulation can make methods and variables private within a class which prevents other classes from accessing them (unless they are made public), therefore, preventing the unauthorised use of them. Only the objects methods can directly manipulate or inspect its fields.

### Inheritance 

Inheritance is the idea of getting or inheriting features from a parent. This concept is essential in Object oriented programming. In OOP this means that a child class (or subclass) can inherit features from a parent class (super class). The child class inherits attributes and methods from the parent class. This enables the child class (subclass) to define new attributes and methods which are then applied to those that were inherited. In other words, what has been inherited can be overridden in the child class and new logic can be created.

### Polymorphism 

Poly is the Greek word for many; morph in the Greek means forms—so polymorphism means the ability to be many forms. In OOP refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on m any forms. Polymorphism incorporates inheritance due to the fact that classes that inherited from the  same parent class (super class) may contain methods (or functions) bearing the same name—but when executed, exhibit different behaviours.
