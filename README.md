Four Pillars of Oject Oriented Programming


Abstraction
Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming. In abstraction, the programmer hides all the irrelevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiencyâ€”hiding the implementation details while presenting the essential features to the user. An example of abstraction can be given with a database system. The user does not know how the data is stored and how the data is maintained to a very technical degree. The complexities are hidden from the user; only that which is essential is exposed.

Encapsulation
Similar to abstraction, encapsulation also hides data, but this time, for the purpose of protection. Encapsulation binds data and functions that manipulate that data into a single unit such as a class (which is a model of objects). For example, in ruby, encapsulation can make methods and variables private within a class which prevents other classes from accessing them (unless they are made public), therefore, preventing the unauthorised use of them. Only the objects methods can directly manipulate or inspect its fields.
