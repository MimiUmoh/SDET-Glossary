### Types of Testing 

#### Specification
Specification tests are derived from the specifications. The tester concentrates on what the software does and **does not** run the code to perform the tests. 

ISTQB Definition: *A procedure to derive and/or select test cases based on an analysis of the specification, either functional or non-functional, of a component or system without reference to its internal structure.*


Overall, these are the types of tests:

| Specification | Structure | Experience | Maintenance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Black box | Control flow diagram | Error guessing | Statement coverage |
| Equivalence partioning | Statement coverage | Exploratory guessing | |
| Boundary Value Analysis | Decision coverage | | |
| Decision Tables | Path coverage
| Use cases |
