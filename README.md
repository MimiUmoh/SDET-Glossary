#### Json
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation(JSON), its primary use is to  transmit data between a web application and a server. They are lightweight text-based and human readable. It is incresinly popular as an alternative to XML. Calling from an API commonly returns JSON format information.

Data wtihin a JSON is displayed like so
```
var Tom = {
	"age" : "25",
	"hometown" : "Cool Town",
	"gender" : "male"
}
```
This creats an object that we access using the variable Tom 

A more complicated exmaple is storing two people within the one variable like so 
```
var family = [{
    "name" : "Jason",
    "age" : "24",
    "gender" : "male"
},
{
    "name" : "Kyle",
    "age" : "21",
    "gender" : "male"
}];
```
This way stores the two poeple in an array represented by the square brackets
