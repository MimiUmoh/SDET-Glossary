#### Test planning and control
  - Determining your exit criteria 
  - Determine what is going to be tested 
  - Who is doing the testing 
  - How it will be achieved 
  - How it is going to be tested 
  - what should be done when the activities do not match with plans 
#### Test analysis and design 
  - Test base is reviewed 
  - Test conditions, cases and procedures 
  - Fine detail of what to test 
  - Designing tests including priority 
#### Test implementation and execution 
  - Most visible part of testing 
  - Prioritising test cases 
  - creating test suites from collected test cases 
  - Log testing activities and defects 
  - Running tests 
  - Comparing actual results with expected results
  - repeate test activities when changes have been made 
#### Evaluating exit criteria and reporting 
  - Has the criteria been met?
  - Does the system do as expected?
  - Determine if more tests need to be made?
  - Is the system ready to be released?
  - Writing up results of the testing 
#### Test closure activities
  - Making sure documents are up to date 
  - Passing over testware to maintenance teams
  - Lessons learned 

#### Life Cycles

Development life cycle â€“ involves capturing the initial requirements from the customer, expanding on these to provide the detail required for code production, writing the code and testing the product, ready for release

Verification - checks the work-product meets the requirements set out for it e.g. ensuring a website built follows the guidelines for making websites usabale by as many people as possible. Ensures we are building the product in the RIGHT WAY.

Validation - focuses on the evaluation of the work-product against user needs e.g. ensuring the behaviour of the work-product matches the customer needs as defined for the project. An example of this is that a website built is also intended for novice users. Validation would include these users checking that they too can use the website easily. Validation ensures we are building the RIGHT PRODUCT as far as the users are concerned.

Waterfall/Linear/Sequential Model:
- Shows the steps in sequence where the requirements are progressively refined to the point where coding can take place.
- Each activity is completed before moving on to the next
- Testing is carried out once the code has been fully developed and then a decision is made whether the product can be released

V-Model/Sequential development model:

The left hand side of the model focuses on elaborating the initial requirement, providing successively more technical detail as development progresses. 

In the model these are:
 - Requirement specification
 - Functional specification
 - Technical specification
 - Program specification

These specifications could be reviewed to check the following:
 - Conformance to the previous work product 
 - That there is sufficient detail for the subsequent work product to be built correctly
 - That it is testable

The middle of the V-Model shows that planning for testing should start with each work-product

The right hand side focuses on testing activities e.g. for each work-product a testing activity is identified. 

In the model these are:
 - Testing against the requirement spec takes place at the acceptance testing stage
 - Testing against the functional spec takes place at the system testing stage
 - Testing against the technical spec takes place at the integration testing stage
 - Testing against the program spec takes place at the unit testing stage

This model allows testing to be concentrated on the detail provided in each work-product so that defects can be identified as early as possible.

Iterative-incremental development models:

Requirements do not need to be fully defined before coding can start. Instead a working version of the product is built in a series of iterations. Each stage encompasses requirements definition, design, code and test. 

Iterative/Cyclical development have defined time scales and cost. Within this, cycles will be defined - these are referred to as time-boxes. For each time-box a requirement is defined and a version of the code is produced. At the end of each time-box a decision is made on what extra functionality needs to be created for the next iteration. This process is repeated until a fully working system is produced. 

A key feature is the involvement of the user reps in the testing. This minimises the risk of developing an unsatisfactory product. The user reps are empowered to request changes to the software to meet their needs.
