 ### DataTypes
  Data types in Ruby represents different types of data like text, string, numbers, etc. All data types are based on classes because it is a Object-Oriented language. There are different data types in Ruby as follows:

                  Numbers
                  Boolean
                  Strings
                  Hashes
                  Arrays
                  Symbols

  Numbers: Generally a number is defined as a series of digits and by using a dot as a decimal mark. There are different kinds of numbers like integers and float.

    E.g. Integer = 3, 30, 300, 3000
         Float = 1.2, 1.23, 1.234, 1.2345

  Boolean: Boolean data type represents only one bit of information either true(1) or false(0).


      E.g.  if true
              puts "It is True!"
            else
              puts "It is False!"
            end

  Strings: A string is a group of letters that represent a sentence or a word. Strings are defined by enclosing a text within a single (”) or double (“”) quotes. You can use both double quotes and single quotes to create strings.

      E.g. puts "String Data Type"

  Hashes: A hash assign its values to its key. Value to a key is assigned by => sign. A key pair is separated with a comma between them and all the pairs are enclosed within curly braces.

      E.g. hash = colors = { "red" => 0xf00, "green" => 0x0f0, "blue" => 0x00f }

  Arrays: An array stores data or list of data. It can contain all types of data. Data in an array are separated by comma in between them and are enclosed within square bracket.The position of elements in an array starts with 0. 

      E.g.  ary = ["fred", 10, 3.14, "This is a string", "last element"]
