### Testing Principles 
  1. Testing shows the presence of bugs 
    - Running a test through a software system can only show that one or more defects exist
    - Testing cannot show that the software is error free
  2. Exhaustive testing is impossible 
    - This is a testing approach in which all possible data combinations are used. This includes implicit data combinations present in the state of the software/data at the start of testing
  3. Early testing 
    - The earlier a problem (defect) is found, the less it costs to fix
  4. Defect clustering 
    - It is often a small number of modules that exhibit the majority of the problems
    - This is the application of the Pareto principle to software testing: approximately 80 percent of the problems are found in 20 percent of the modules
  5. The pesticide paradox 
    - Running the same set of the tests continually will not continue to find new defects 
  6. Testing is context dependent 
    - Different testing is necessary in different circumstances
    - Risk can be a large factor in determining the type of testing that is needed
  7. Absence of errors fallacy 
    - Software with no known errors is not necessarily ready to be shipped
