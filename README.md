Four Pillars of Oject Oriented Programming


Abstraction

Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming. The programmer hides all the irrelevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiencyâ€”hiding the implementation details while presenting the essential features to the user. An example of abstraction can be given with a database system. The user does not know how the data is stored and how the data is maintained to a very technical degree. The complexities are hidden from the user; only that which is essential is exposed.
