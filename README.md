### Glossary Terms 

Test tool - a software product that supports one or more test activities such as planning and control, specification, building initial files and data, test execution and test analysis

Incident management tools/Defect management tools:
- Used to perform two critical activities: creation of an incident report and maintenance of the details about the incident as it progresses through the incident life cycle
- Use a database to store/manage details of incidents. This allows the incident to be categorised according to values stored in the appropriate fields.

Requirement management tools:
- Used by BAs to record, manage and priorities the requirements of a system. 
- Use of a traceability function enables links and references to be made between requirements, functions, test conditions and other testware items so as requirements change it is easy to identify which other items may need to change. 

Configuration management tools:
- Designed primarily for managing the versions of different software and hardware components that compromise a complete build of the system. 
- Allows traceability between testware and builds of an integrated system and versions of subsystems and modules. This is useful for identifying the correct version of test procedures, determining which test procedures can be reused or need to be updated/maintained and tracing back to previous versions for debugging purposes

Review tools:
- Provide a framework for reviews or inspections, this can include:
 - Maintaining information about the review process such as rules and checklists
 - The ability to record, communication and retain review comments/defects
 - The ability to amend the deliverable under review while retaining a log of the changes made
 - Traceability functions

Static analysis tools:
- Analyse code before it is executed in order to identify defects as early as possible, so therefore are mainly used by developers prior to unit testing
- Medium/large changes to existing code requires the use of a static analysis tool
- Used to enforce programming standards, improve the understanding of code and to calculate complexity and other metrics

Modelling tools:
