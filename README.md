 ### DataTypes
  Data types in Ruby represents different types of data like text, string, numbers, etc. All data types are based on classes because it is a Object-Oriented language. There are different data types in Ruby as follows:

                  Numbers
                  Boolean
                  Strings
                  Hashes
                  Arrays
                  Symbols

  #### Numbers:
   Generally a number is defined as a series of digits and by using a dot as a decimal mark. There are different kinds of numbers like integers and float.

      E.g. Integer = 3, 30, 300, 3000
          Float = 1.2, 1.23, 1.234, 1.2345

  #### Boolean:
   Boolean data type represents only one bit of information either true(1) or false(0).


      E.g.  if true
              puts "It is True!"
            else
              puts "It is False!"
            end

  #### Strings: 
  A string is a group of letters that represent a sentence or a word. Strings are defined by enclosing a text within a single (”) or double (“”) quotes. You can use both double quotes and single quotes to create strings.

      E.g. puts "String Data Type"

  #### Hashes: 
  A hash assign its values to its key. Value to a key is assigned by => sign. A key pair is separated with a comma between them and all the pairs are enclosed within curly braces.

      E.g. hash = colors = { "red" => 0xf00, "green" => 0x0f0, "blue" => 0x00f }

  #### Arrays: 
  An array stores data or list of data. It can contain all types of data. Data in an array are separated by comma in between them and are enclosed within square bracket.The position of elements in an array starts with 0. 

      E.g.  ary = ["fred", 10, 3.14, "This is a string", "last element"]


#### Symbols :

  A Symbol is basically the same as a String, but with one important difference. A Symbol is immutable. They are usually generated by using :name literal syntax

#### MVC
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development framework to create scalable and extensible projects.

Model -
The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. This can represent either the data that is being transferred between the View and Controller components or any other business logic-related data. For example, a Customer object will retrieve the customer information from the database, manipulate it and update it data back to the database or use it to render data.

View -
The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application. For example, the Customer view will include all the UI components such as text boxes, dropdowns, etc. that the final user interacts with.

Controller -
Controllers act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the Views to render the final output. For example, the Customer controller will handle all the interactions and inputs from the Customer View and update the database using the Customer Model. The same controller will be used to view the Customer data.
 
#### GEMS

Gem is a ruby software package which offers specific functionalities to programs that run ruby. For example, if you want to have a function that lets you authenticate within your program so you don't always need to write one out, you can get it in form of a gem to put within the program. Gems are stored in a file called in Ruby Gemfile. This file has to be located in the root of the project in order for the gems to run.

##### HTTParty

HTTParty is a gem you can use in Ruby to help call an external API through the use of request methods, such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. Through the use of the HTTParty gem, it helps to expose the module and encapsulate all of the methods from that specific module to help with calling the external API through the different request methods. 

##### Dotenv

Dotenv helps to load enviromental variables from an .env file into a specific file by calling it within the methods. If you want more information on this, click on the following link: https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv

##### JSON

JSON gem helps provide the methods to use within your class in your project, so that you can easily parse through external API's into a json format.
